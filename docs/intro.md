# Introduction

**Code Autopilot** is tool that applies SOTA LLMs to software development processes. You can ask it to:

- Provide step-by-step instructions on how to **implement features**
- **Fix bugs**
- **Explain** how a codebase works


## Getting Started

To use Autopilot, you need to have a github account and your code hosted in a github repository.

Steps:
1. Install our [Github App](https://github.com/marketplace/code-autopilot-ai-coder) in your repositories
2. Go to one of the repositories where you installed the app and [**create a new issue**](./getting-started/createissue)
3. Autopilot will start indexing your repository and will reply to your issue with a suggested solution

By default, autopilot will work on all issue opened, but it is possible to change that setting.

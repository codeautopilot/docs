# Create a new issue

Autopilot listens to Github issues created in your repositories (more integrations coming soon).

To open a new issue, go to one of your repositories on Github, go to the Issues tab and click on "New issue".

The video below shows the process using [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT) Github repository as an example.

Autopilot will immediately detect your issue and start working on a solution
